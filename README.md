## 📊 Objectives  
- Perform **EDA** on consumer shopping behavior data.  
- Identify key spending drivers: **age, gender, income, product category**.  
- Segment consumers into **high-value vs price-sensitive groups**.  
- Build **classification and regression models** to predict spending behavior.  
- Provide **business recommendations** for marketing and product strategy.

## ⚙️ Methodology  
1. **Data Preprocessing** – Handle missing values, encode categorical variables.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Distribution plots, correlation heatmaps, spending trends.  
3. **Segmentation** – Cluster analysis for consumer groups.  
4. **Modeling** – Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting for behavior prediction.  
5. **Evaluation** – Accuracy, F1-score, RMSE depending on task.
